# Agent Guidelines for `products`

## Scope
Applies to product domain logic.

## Product Model Philosophy
- Products encompass physical, virtual, bundled, manufacturable, and service offerings. Avoid assumptions that limit logic to shippable goods.
- Ensure features work for both sellable and non-sellable product variants.
- When adding behaviour, confirm compatibility across configurables, bundles, manufactured goods, and simple SKUs.
