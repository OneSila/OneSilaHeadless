# Agent Guidelines for `sales_prices`

## Scope
Covers files under `OneSila/sales_prices/`.

## Notes
- This module currently lacks detailed documentation. Before implementing changes, inspect existing code to understand active pricing flows.
- Align naming, folder layout, and separation of responsibilities with the project-wide conventions described in the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Add regression tests whenever modifying price calculations or list management.
