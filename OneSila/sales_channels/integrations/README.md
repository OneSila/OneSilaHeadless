# Integrations Folder README

This document explains how to add new sales-channel integrations under `sales_channels/integrations/` so we keep a consistent structure and approach across all integrations (e.g., Magento, Shopify, etc.).

## Macro steps to follow

To do this integration:
0. If necessary do oAuth.
1. Do the PULL factories (or you end up with strange situations in the final step when creating the ProductSyncFactories)
2. Make sure your SalesChannelViewAssign SalesChannelView and SalesChannel infrastructure exists and your test-mixins are connected to it
3. You do the Attributes, Media, etc.
4. Lastly the Productfactories
5. Only now do the import factories


## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
sales_channels/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integrations/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ magento2/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factories/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mixins.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚Ä¶
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shopify/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factories/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mixins.py
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚Ä¶
```

- **Root integration package**: `sales_channels/integrations` is a Python package (contains `__init__.py`).
- **Each integration** is a Django app (one directory per channel):
  - Name the directory after the integration (e.g., `shopify`, `magento2`).
  - Inside each, you'll have standard Django app files (`apps.py`, `models.py`, `views.py` if needed), plus your layered subfolders:
    - `models.py` ‚Äì sales-channel-specific mirror models
    - `mixins.py` ‚Äì API client mixins (e.g., `GetMagentoAPIMixin`, `GetShopifyAPIMixin`)
    - `factories/` ‚Äì layered `CreateFactory` / `UpdateFactory` classes
    - `admin.py`, etc., as required.

## Creating a New Integration App

1. **Use the management command to scaffold a new integration**
   ```bash
   python manage.py create_sales_channel_integration <integration_name>
   ```

   This command will:
   - Create the integration directory
   - Generate the app structure
   - Set up the `AppConfig`
   - Create necessary subfolders and files
   - Generate boilerplate for models, mixins, and factories

2. **Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`**
```

- **Root integration package**: `sales_channels/integrations` is a Python package (contains `__init__.py`).
- **Each integration** is a Django app (one directory per channel):
  - Name the directory after the integration (e.g., `shopify`, `magento2`).
  - Inside each, you‚Äôll have standard Django app files (`apps.py`, `models.py`, `views.py` if needed), plus your layered subfolders:
    - `models.py` ‚Äì sales-channel-specific mirror models
    - `mixins.py` ‚Äì API client mixins (e.g., `GetMagentoAPIMixin`, `GetShopifyAPIMixin`)
    - `factories/` ‚Äì layered `CreateFactory` / `UpdateFactory` classes
    - `admin.py`, etc., as required.

## üöÄ Creating a New Integration App

1. **Ensure the integrations package exists**
   ```bash
   ls sales_channels/integrations/__init__.py
   ```

2. **Scaffold a new Django app** under `integrations/`. Two options:
   - **Option A (preferred)**: Pre-create the folder, then run `startapp` into it:
     ```bash
     mkdir sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>
     python manage.py startapp <integration_name> sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>
     ```
   - **Option B**: Change directory into `integrations`, then run `startapp`:
     ```bash
     cd sales_channels/integrations
     python ../../manage.py startapp <integration_name>
     ```

3. **Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`**
   In your settings (e.g. `base.py`), register the new app:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ‚Ä¶
       'sales_channels.integrations.magento2',
       'sales_channels.integrations.shopify',  # new integration
       # ‚Ä¶
   ]
   ```

   4. **Define AppConfig**
      In `sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>/apps.py`:
      ```python
      from django.apps import AppConfig

      class <IntegrationName>Config(AppConfig):
          name = 'sales_channels.integrations.<integration_name>'
          default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
          verbose_name = '<Integration Name> Integration'
      ```

Create skeleton for integration:
 ```bash
./manage.py create_skeleton sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>
 ```

+ Make sure in the app.py file the ready method was correctly added

5. **Create subfolders**
   Mirror the Magento/Shopify pattern:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>/{factories,mixins}
   touch sales_channels/integrations/<integration_name>/mixins.py
   ```

6. **Layered architecture**
   - **Layer 1**: `IntegrationInstanceCreateFactory` & `IntegrationInstanceUpdateFactory` live in a shared base (e.g., `sales_channels/factories/`).
   - **Layer 2**: `RemoteXxxCreateFactory` subclasses for all channels (in each integration‚Äôs `factories/`).
   - **Layer 3**: Channel‚Äëspecific details (`MagentoPropertyCreateFactory`, `ShopifyProductCreateFactory`, etc.).

7. **Models**
   - Define your channel‚Äôs mirror models in `models.py`:
     ```python
     class ShopifySalesChannel(SalesChannel):
         shop_url = models.URLField()
         access_token = models.CharField(max_length=255)
         # ‚Ä¶

     class ShopifyProduct(RemoteProduct):
         # any Shopify‚Äëspecific fields
     ```

8. **API mixin**
   In `mixins.py`, add your `Get<Integration>APIMixin` that encapsulates session setup and activation.

9. **Factories**
   In `factories/products.py`, scaffold your `CreateFactory` and `UpdateFactory`:
   ```python
   class ShopifyProductCreateFactory(RemoteInstanceCreateFactory):
       local_model_class   = Product
       remote_model_class  = ShopifyProduct
       api_package_name    = 'product'
       api_method_name     = 'create'
       field_mapping       = { 'local_field': 'remote_field', ‚Ä¶ }
       default_field_mapping = { ‚Ä¶ }
       # override customize_payload(), serialize_response(), etc.
   ```

10. **Testing & Sanity Check**
   - Write a TESTS to instantiate your mixin and factories, call .run(), and verify your integration API sees your test data.
   - Add any admin registrations or serializers as needed.
   - Add the logins to a fake test-store to your local settings and set it up in github as well.
   - Write a quick Django shell script to instantiate your mixin and factories, call .run(), and verify the Shopify API sees your test product.
   - Add any admin registrations or serializers as needed.

## Help / Tips & Tricks

- **Magic failure of factories?**: Ensure the products you're testing with are assigned to the a sales channel view.  Often the reason is silent failure of the pre-flight checks, which stops the factory from running without any feedback.
